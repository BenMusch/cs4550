      <p>
      To register an account, Alice first visits the home page and clicks the
      "register account" link. This bring her to the new account form, where she
      enters her email address, username, and password. After submitting the
      form, she waits for an email to confirm her email address. Upon clicking
      the link in the email, her new account is ready to use.

      <!-- Story 2 -->
      <em>As a user, I should be able to create a message</em>
      <p>
      When logged in, Alice visits the home page and starts typing into the
      text field with the placeholder "Write your message". When she finishes
      the message, she clicks "Post message". The post is now visible on her
      home page.
      </p>

      <!-- Story 3 -->
      <em>As a user, I should be able to follow a user</em>
      <p>
      When logged in, Alice searches for a user "bob". On the list of results,
      she sees the of the user the name of the user with the username "bob".
      She clicks the "follow" button next to bob's name, and sees a message that
      she is now following bob.
      </p>

      <!-- Story 4 -->
      <em>As a user following other users, their messages should show up on my feed</em>
      <p>
      Alice is following the user "bob". When Alice is on her homepage, she
      should see the most recent messages posted by "bob".

      <!-- Story 5 -->
      <em>As an unregistered user, I should be able read messages by users</em>
      <p>
      As a user without an account, I search for the username "bob". I see a
      list of users with a username similar to "bob". When I click on the name
      of the first user on the list, I should see the messages that user has
      posted.
      </p>

      <!-- Story 6 -->
      <em>As an unregistered user, I should not be able to create a post</em>
      <p>
      As a user without an account, I navigate to the homepage. The textbox
      where registered users can write messages is disabled, and displays a
      message telling me that I must register for an account to post messages.
